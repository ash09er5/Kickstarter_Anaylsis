# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
In this project we will get our feet wet in learning the ins and outs of microsoft excel and how to use it to analyze
sets of data to draw conclusions and make predictions based on trends.

### Purpose
The purpose of this challenge is to find different relationships based on the data to draw different conclusions about the success 
of different plays. 
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
A Challenge that i had was with the outcomes based on goals chart as the data was not correct as the chart in the example did not match up with what i had. There minght have been a small mistake somewhere but i was not able to identify it. How ever due to time constraints i did not have time to correct the problem. Other than that the main challenges i had with the was entering the excel formulas with the correct syntax because i would get errors if something was not typed correctly. And one final issue i had was with the VLOOKUP command i was having truoble with it as things were not executing correcly.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
One Conclusion you can draw is that as the season changes the number of succesfful campaigns drops significantly

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The Bigger the budget the less likely the play was going to fail
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
There isnt more data on why the plays failed or why they were sucessful. more insight into this would help make stronger cases for my plays are sucessful

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
display if certain genres did better then others you can predict what people like and are willing to pay more for.
